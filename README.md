# ProximitySensing-With-Chirpino

A simple project that sends information-carrying "chirps" with the [Chirpino Library](https://github.com/chirp/chirpino) from [Chirp](http://chirp.io/) when a proximity sensor detects something close by.

This [clip](https://youtu.be/DYtHKVjqazE) shows the project in action.

The proximity sensor used in this project is an [Infrared Proximity Sensor from Sharp](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/242).
