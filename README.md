# ProximitySensing-With-Chirpino

A simple project that sends chirps with the [Chirpino Library](https://github.com/chirp/chirpino) from [Chirp Library](http://chirp.io/) when a proximity sensor detects something close by. 

The proximity sensor used in this project is an Infrared Proximity Sensor from Sharp (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/242).
